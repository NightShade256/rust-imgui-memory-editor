# Dear ImGui Memory Editor

Safe Rust bindings to the Dear ImGui memory editor widget, to be used with `imgui-rs`.

## Note

This crate is *not* published on `crates.io` since there is already
a crate which implements bindings to the widget with the same name.

The crate on `crates.io` is outdated, and has a totally different API than this crate.

This crate tries to stay close to the original widget's API.

## Documentation

You can access the docs for this crate [here](https://nightshade256.github.io/rust-imgui-memory-editor/imgui_memory_editor/index.html).

## License

Both the `sys` and wrapper crates are licensed under the MIT license.
